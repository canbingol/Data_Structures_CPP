# Data Structures in C++

This project implements fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms in C++. The goal is to gain in-depth knowledge of data structures and effectively utilize the features offered by the C++ language.

## Data Structures

This project includes the following data structures:

1. **Single Linked List**: Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node, allowing for dynamic growth.
2. **Double Linked List**: Each node contains a value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node, enabling traversal in both directions.
3. **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, used for organizing data.

## Sorting Algorithms

This project also implements sorting algorithms:

1. **Selection Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the sorted region.

2. **Insertion Sort**: An efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by comparing the current element to the already sorted elements and placing it in the correct position.
