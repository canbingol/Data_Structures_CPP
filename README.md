# Data Structures in C++

This project implements fundamental data structures in C++. The goal is to gain in-depth knowledge of data structures and effectively utilize the features offered by the C++ language.

## Data Structures

This project includes the following data structures:
1. **Single Linked List**: Each node contains a value and a pointer to the next node, allowing for dynamic growth.
2. **Double Linked List**: Each node contains a value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node, enabling traversal in both directions.
3. **Binary Tree**: A hierarchical structure where each node has at most two children, used for organizing data.
